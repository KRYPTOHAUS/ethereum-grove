# Grove

Grove provides indexed storage for ordered data such that it can be efficiently
queried.

You can use grove as a library either by deploying the `GroveLib` contract
yourself, or using the one deployed at
`0xd07ce4329b27eb8896c51458468d98a0e4c0394c`.

Alternatively, you can interact with grove as a standalone service via the `Grove` contract either by deploying it yourself, or using the one deployed at `0x8017f24a47c889b1ee80501ff84beb3c017edf0b`.

If you would like to verify either of the contract's source, they were compiled using version
`0.1.5-23865e39` of the `solc` compiler with the `--optimize` flag turned.
